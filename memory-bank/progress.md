### Interactive Activities
- âœ… Poll activity with basic visualization
- âœ… Quiz activity with scoring
- âœ… Word Cloud generation
- âœ… Q&A with upvoting and moderation
- âœ… Real-time response collection
- âœ… Result visualization for presenters

### Connection Management
- âœ… Robust socket connection handling
- âœ… Multiple heartbeat mechanisms
- âœ… Reconnection with exponential backoff
- âœ… Session state persistence during disconnections

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **WebSocket Connection in Restricted Networks**
   - **Issue**: Some corporate networks block WebSocket connections
   - **Workaround**: Automatic fallback to HTTP polling
   - **Status**: Working on enhanced detection and feedback

2. **Mobile Device Sleep Disconnects**
   - **Issue**: Mobile devices lose connection when entering sleep mode
   - **Workaround**: Reconnection on activity resumption
   - **Status**: Implementing improved detection and recovery

### High Priority Issues
1. **Large Session Performance**
   - **Issue**: Performance degradation with 100+ concurrent participants
   - **Workaround**: Limiting active participants per session
   - **Status**: Planning optimization work

2. **Quiz Results Visualization**
   - **Issue**: Quiz results can be difficult to interpret with many questions
   - **Workaround**: Limited question display
   - **Status**: Designing improved visualization

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Export Format Limitations**
   - **Issue**: Limited export formats (CSV only)
   - **Workaround**: Manual post-processing
   - **Status**: Planning PDF export implementation
