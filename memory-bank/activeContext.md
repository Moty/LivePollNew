# Active Context

## Current Focus

Our immediate development focus is on enhancing interactive activities with advanced capabilities and beginning development of the analytics dashboard for LearnConnectLive. We've completed the planned improvements for poll visualizations, quiz timers, and word cloud styling, and are now focusing on Q&A answer tracking and analytics functionality.

### Primary Goals

1. **Interactive Activity Enhancements**
   - Complete answer tracking capabilities for Q&A activities
   - Implement comprehensive analytics for all activity types
   - Further enhance mobile experience for participants

2. **Analytics Dashboard Development**
   - Create comprehensive metrics for engagement and participation
   - Design intuitive visualization of session results
   - Implement export capabilities with customizable options

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Improve presentation experience with multiple concurrent activities
   - Optimize real-time updates for large participant groups
   - Enhance session state recovery mechanisms

### Backend Enhancements
- ✅ Added robust session lookup mechanisms
- ✅ Improved participant tracking and counting
- ✅ Enhanced server-side event handling
- ✅ Added fallback to mock data when database is unavailable

## Current Challenges

### Interactive Activity Edge Cases
- Q&A activities need more robust answer tracking capabilities
- Some activities perform poorly with very large participant counts
- Need better methods for exporting results in various formats

### Scaling Concerns
- Current architecture needs optimization for large presentation sessions (100+ participants)
- Real-time updates can create performance bottlenecks with many concurrent users
- Database access patterns need optimization for high-volume sessions

### Analytics Requirements
- Need comprehensive metrics for tracking engagement over time
- Export functionality needs enhancement for reporting
- Data visualization requires consistent approach across activities

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Test Activity Mode Functionality**
   - Conduct thorough testing across all activity types
   - Validate settings persistence between edit/present modes
   - Ensure consistent behavior

2. **Review and Refine**
   - Check for console warnings or errors (especially styled-components related)
   - Review recent changes for potential improvements

3. **Gather User Feedback**
   - Collect feedback on the updated activity editing experience

4. **Documentation**
   - Update developer/user docs regarding the `mode` setting and modal behavior

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
1. **Complete Q&A Answer Tracking**
   - Add mark as answered, answer text field, filtering

2. **Begin Analytics Dashboard**
   - Design layout, define metrics, create components
   - Implement data collection pipeline

### Long-term (3+ Months)
1. **Complete Analytics Dashboard**
   - Time-based metrics, participant tracking, comparison tools

2. **Enhance Export Functionality**
   - PDF reports, templates, batch export

3. **Database Optimization & Enterprise Features**
   - Caching, query optimization, LMS/SSO integration

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision Point | Current Decision | Alternatives Considered | Status |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Socket.IO Transport | Force polling as primary, WebSocket as fallback | WebSocket-only, Server-Sent Events | Implemented |
| Connection Recovery | Multiple heartbeat mechanisms with forcePersistentConnection | Single reconnection strategy, HTTP fallback | Implemented |
| Error Visualization | Clear status indicators with manual retry options | Automatic-only retry, minimal UI | Implemented |
| Data Fallback | Mock data service when DB unavailable | Error-only behavior, cached-only data | Implemented |
| Chart Library | Chart.js for visualizations | D3.js, Victory, Recharts | Implemented |
| Word Cloud Library | d3-cloud with custom enhancements | react-wordcloud, wordcloud2.js | Implemented |

### Feature Priorities

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Poll Visualization Options | High | Medium | Completed |
| Quiz Timed Questions | Medium | High | Completed |
| Word Cloud Styling | Medium | Medium | Completed |
| Q&A Answer Tracking | High | Medium | In Progress |
| Analytics Dashboard | High | High | Planning |
| PDF Export | Medium | Medium | Not Started |
| Participant Tracking | High | Medium | Planning |

## Key Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Component Customization**: Creating consistent customization interfaces (e.g., color schemes, animation controls) across different activity types greatly improves maintainability and presenter experience.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Building features with layered functionality (basic → advanced) allows us to provide a good experience on all devices while enhancing capabilities on more powerful devices.

3. **Real-time Performance**: Throttling and debouncing updates to visual elements (especially charts and word clouds) significantly improves performance with large datasets.

### User Experience Insights
1. **Presenter Controls**: Presenters strongly prefer having granular control over visualization options but benefit from having them hidden by default to avoid overwhelming the interface.

2. **Participant Engagement**: Interactive elements with immediate visual feedback (like countdown timers and animations) significantly increase participant engagement.

3. **Mobile Usage**: Mobile participants engage most with simple interaction models (single tap selection) and clear visual feedback on submission.
