# Active Context

## Current Focus

Our immediate development focus is on strengthening the core functionality of LearnConnectLive, particularly around socket connection reliability and enhancing the interactive activities with advanced visualization options.

### Primary Goals

1. **Socket Connection Stability**
   - Ensure reliable socket connections even in challenging network environments
   - Improve reconnection strategies and error recovery mechanisms
   - Enhance user feedback during connection issues

2. **Enhanced Activity Visualizations**
   - Implement advanced chart options for polls (bar, pie, doughnut, horizontal)
   - Add animation controls for result updates
   - Create more customization options for word clouds

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Improve initial load time for presentations
   - Optimize real-time updates to minimize performance impact
   - Enhance mobile experience for participants

## Current Challenges

### Socket Connection Edge Cases
- Some environments with strict firewall rules block WebSocket connections
- Intermittent network drops require better recovery mechanisms
- Mobile devices entering sleep mode lose connections that need recovery

### Scaling Concerns
- Current architecture needs optimization for large presentation sessions (100+ participants)
- Real-time updates can create performance bottlenecks with many concurrent users
- Database access patterns need optimization for high-volume sessions

### Feature Gaps
- Advanced visualization options not yet implemented for all activity types
- Limited analytics for session engagement tracking
- Export functionality needs enhancement for comprehensive reporting

   - LMS integration capabilities
   - SSO authentication options
   - Custom branding options

2. Add advanced collaboration features
   - Team management for presenters
   - Collaborative presentation editing
   - Shared analytics and insights

3. Develop offline capabilities
   - Full offline mode for presentations
   - Background synchronization when connectivity returns
   - Local-first data architecture

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision Point | Current Decision | Alternatives Considered | Status |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Socket.IO Transport | Force polling as primary, WebSocket as fallback | WebSocket-only, Server-Sent Events | Implemented |
| Connection Recovery | Multiple heartbeat mechanisms with forcePersistentConnection | Single reconnection strategy, HTTP fallback | Implemented |
| Error Visualization | Clear status indicators with manual retry options | Automatic-only retry, minimal UI | Implemented |
| Data Fallback | Mock data service when DB unavailable | Error-only behavior, cached-only data | Implemented |
| Chart Library | Chart.js for visualizations | D3.js, Victory, Recharts | Under Review |

### Feature Priorities

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Poll Visualization Options | High | Medium | In Progress |
| Quiz Timed Questions | Medium | High | Planned |
| Word Cloud Filtering | Medium | Medium | Planned |
| PDF Export | Medium | High | Not Started |
| Analytics Dashboard | High | High | Not Started |
| Participant Tracking | High | Medium | Partially Implemented |

## Key Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Socket Connection Management**: Implementing multiple parallel heartbeat mechanisms significantly improves connection stability, especially in variable network environments.

2. **Error Recovery Strategy**: A "session-first" approach (prioritizing maintaining session state over connection state) provides a better user experience during brief disconnections.

3. **Fallback Architecture**: The ability to fall back to mock data when the database is unavailable allows for graceful degradation rather than complete failure.

### User Experience Insights
1. **Connection Feedback**: Users strongly prefer clear visual indicators of connection status with actionable recovery options rather than automatic-only behavior.

2. **Performance Perception**: Loading indicators with progress information (e.g., time elapsed) reduce perceived wait times even when actual loading times are unchanged.

3. **Mobile Usage Patterns**: Mobile participants often switch between apps or put devices to sleep, necessitating robust reconnection capabilities.
