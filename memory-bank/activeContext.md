## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision Point | Current Decision | Alternatives Considered | Status |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Socket.IO Transport | Force polling as primary, WebSocket as fallback | WebSocket-only, Server-Sent Events | Implemented |
| Connection Recovery | Multiple heartbeat mechanisms with forcePersistentConnection | Single reconnection strategy, HTTP fallback | Implemented |
| Error Visualization | Clear status indicators with manual retry options | Automatic-only retry, minimal UI | Implemented |
| Data Fallback | Mock data service when DB unavailable | Error-only behavior, cached-only data | Implemented |
| Chart Library | Chart.js for visualizations | D3.js, Victory, Recharts | Implemented |
| Word Cloud Library | d3-cloud with custom enhancements | react-wordcloud, wordcloud2.js | Implemented |

### Feature Priorities

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Poll Visualization Options | High | Medium | Completed |

## Key Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Component Customization**: Creating consistent customization interfaces (e.g., color schemes, animation controls) across different activity types greatly improves maintainability and presenter experience.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Building features with layered functionality (basic → advanced) allows us to provide a good experience on all devices while enhancing capabilities on more powerful devices.

3. **Real-time Performance**: Throttling and debouncing updates to visual elements (especially charts and word clouds) significantly improves performance with large datasets.

### User Experience Insights
1. **Presenter Controls**: Presenters strongly prefer having granular control over visualization options but benefit from having them hidden by default to avoid overwhelming the interface.

2. **Participant Engagement**: Interactive elements with immediate visual feedback (like countdown timers and animations) significantly increase participant engagement.

3. **Mobile Usage**: Mobile participants engage most with simple interaction models (single tap selection) and clear visual feedback on submission.
