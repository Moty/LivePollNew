# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Traditional classroom and presentation environments often struggle with:

1. **Limited engagement**: One-way communication leads to passive learning
2. **Uneven participation**: A few voices dominate while others remain silent
3. **Delayed feedback**: Presenters can't gauge understanding in real-time
4. **Reduced retention**: Lack of interaction decreases information retention
5. **Participation barriers**: Many participants avoid speaking up in groups
6. **Assessment challenges**: Difficult to measure engagement and understanding

LearnConnectLive addresses these challenges by providing a platform for real-time, interactive engagement that works in both in-person and remote settings.
