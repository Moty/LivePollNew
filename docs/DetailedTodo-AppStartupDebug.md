# Debugging App Startup Issue

## Problem Statement
The application does not start when running `npm start dev:full` command.

## Investigation Plan
1. Verify script configuration in package.json
2. Check for environment variables and configuration files
3. Inspect frontend and backend dependencies
4. Check for errors in server.js
5. Test running frontend and backend separately
6. Document any error messages and fix the issue

## Steps to Execute
1. Run backend service separately
2. Run frontend service separately 
3. Check for any error messages
4. Verify environment configuration
5. Test the complete startup with `npm run dev:full`
6. Document the solution

## Findings
1. Backend service starts successfully using `npm run dev:backend`
2. Frontend fails to compile with multiple dependency errors:
   - Missing `react-router-dom` 
   - Missing `styled-components`
   - Missing `react-chartjs-2`
   - Missing `chart.js`

## Solution Implemented
1. Installed the missing frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install react-router-dom styled-components react-chartjs-2 chart.js
   ```
2. Frontend now compiles and runs successfully
3. Full application starts correctly with `npm run dev:full`

## Resolution
The issue was resolved by installing the missing frontend dependencies. The application now starts correctly with both the backend server running on port 5001 and the frontend running on port 3000.

Note: There were some npm deprecation warnings during dependency installation, but they don't affect the application's functionality.
