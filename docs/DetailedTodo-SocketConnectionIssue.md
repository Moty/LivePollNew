# Debugging Socket Connection Issue

## Problem Statement
After clicking on "present" in the application, the presenter view loads correctly but after a few seconds displays a "Server Connection Issue" message indicating problems connecting to the server.

## Investigation Plan
1. Examine the socket implementation in the backend
2. Check the socket connection setup in the frontend
3. Verify socket configuration parameters and timeouts
4. Check for any errors in network connections
5. Test socket connection functionality

## Steps to Execute
1. Examine the socket service implementation in the backend
2. Check the presenter view component in the frontend
3. Verify socket.io configuration parameters
4. Test socket connections and identify any failure points
5. Fix the identified issues

## Findings
1. The backend socket service is configured properly with Socket.IO
2. The frontend PresentationView component attempts to connect to the socket server with these parameters:
   ```javascript
   // Socket URL configuration
   const socketUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL || 'http://localhost:5001';
   
   // Socket connection options
   transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
   ```
3. There's a connection timeout mechanism in the frontend that might be triggering too early
4. The reconnection logic seems complex with multiple reconnection attempts

## Potential Issues Identified
1. Connection timeout might be too short (currently set to 10 seconds)
2. Socket.IO transport options may be limited (currently using websocket and polling)
3. CORS settings might be preventing proper connection
4. Environment variables might not be properly configured

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Increased Socket Connection Timeout
Modified the socket connection timeout settings in the frontend:
```javascript
// Increased socket.io connection timeout
const options = {
  url: socketUrl,
  options: {
    autoConnect: false,
    reconnection: true,
    reconnectionAttempts: 10, // Increased from 5
    reconnectionDelay: 1000,
    reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,
    timeout: 20000, // Increased from 10000 to 20000 ms
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
  }
};

// Increased explicit connection timeout
const connectionTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  // Timeout logic...
}, 15000); // Increased from 6000 to 15000 ms
```

### 2. Enhanced Heartbeat Mechanism
Added a more frequent heartbeat to keep the connection alive:
```javascript
// More frequent heartbeat interval
const pingInterval = setInterval(() => {
  if (isMountedRef.current && newSocket.connected) {
    console.log('Sending heartbeat ping to server');
    newSocket.emit('heartbeat', {
      sessionId: session?.id || null,
      sessionCode: sessionCode || null,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
}, 20000); // Reduced from 30 seconds to 20 seconds
```

### 3. Updated Backend CORS Configuration
Modified the backend CORS settings to be more permissive:
```javascript
// Socket.IO CORS configuration
const io = socketIO(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: '*', // Allow connections from any origin for development
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    credentials: true,
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
  },
  pingTimeout: 120000, // Increased timeout to 2 minutes
  pingInterval: 25000,
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
});

// Express CORS configuration
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*', // Allow requests from any origin for development
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  credentials: true,
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```

### 4. Verified Environment Variables
The environment variables in `.env` file are correctly configured:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

## Expected Outcome
These changes should improve the socket connection reliability and prevent the "Server Connection Issue" message from appearing. The application should now maintain a stable connection between the presenter view and the server.
