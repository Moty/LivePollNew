# DetailedTodo for Dashboard and CreatePresentation Updates

## Current Issues
1. Dashboard component using mock data instead of real API calls 
2. Activities not being properly added in CreatePresentation component 
3. Project structure documentation needs updating 

## Code Examination Findings

### Dashboard Component Issues 
1. API Integration:
   - Using mock data instead of real API calls 
   - Missing error handling 
   - No loading states 
   - No refresh mechanism 

2. UI/UX Issues:
   - No loading indicator 
   - Poor error handling 
   - No confirmation dialogs 
   - Basic empty states 

3. State Management:
   - Inefficient filtering 
   - No proper sorting 
   - No refresh after create/edit 

### CreatePresentation Component Issues 
1. Activity Addition Flow:
   - The `handleAddActivity` function is incomplete 
   - No visual feedback 
   - Missing validation 
   - No proper activity type management 

2. API Integration:
   - The `createPresentation` API call lacks proper error handling 
   - No loading states 
   - Missing activity validation 

3. UI/UX Issues:
   - No loading indicator 
   - No confirmation before canceling 
   - No preview of added activities 

### API Service Status
1. Working Features:
   - Basic API setup with axios
   - Development token handling
   - Error interceptors
   - Basic CRUD operations for presentations

2. Missing Features:
   - No specific activity validation
   - No retry logic for failed requests
   - No request caching
   - No offline support

## Current Status Summary
All planned dashboard and presentation creation improvements have been completed. The Dashboard is now using real API data instead of mock data, with proper loading states, error handling, and refresh mechanisms. The CreatePresentation component has been fixed to properly handle activity addition with visual feedback and validation.

### Key Improvements Implemented:
1. Replaced mock data with real API calls in the Dashboard
2. Added loading states and error handling for better user experience
3. Implemented refresh mechanisms to keep data current
4. Fixed activity addition in the CreatePresentation component
5. Added proper validation and visual feedback for activity creation
6. Enhanced UI with loading indicators, confirmation dialogs, and error displays

## Next Steps
The focus should now move to enhancing the API service with:
1. Request caching for better performance
2. Retry logic for failed requests
3. Offline support capabilities
4. Enhanced data validation
5. Advanced error handling

Following that, UI/UX improvements could include:
1. More advanced visualization options for activities
2. Enhanced filtering and sorting in the dashboard
3. Better mobile responsiveness
4. Accessibility improvements

## Implementation Order
1. Fix activity addition in CreatePresentation
2. Update Dashboard to use real API
3. Enhance API service
4. Add UI/UX improvements
