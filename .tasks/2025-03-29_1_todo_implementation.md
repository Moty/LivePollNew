# Task Description
Continue implementation as described in the TODO.md file, focusing on the unimplemented features.

# Project Overview
LearnConnectLive is a real-time interactive presentation platform that allows presenters to engage with their audience through various interactive activities like polls, quizzes, Q&A sessions, and word clouds. The project uses React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, with Socket.IO for real-time communication.

⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️
# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Create feature branch
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN_BRANCH]:
  ```
  git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK_FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
  ```
  git branch --show-current
  ```
4. Update "Current execution step" in [TASK_FILE] to next step

## 2. Create the task file
1. Execute command to generate [TASK_FILE_NAME]:
   ```
   [TASK_FILE_NAME]="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_$(($(ls -1q .tasks | grep -c $(date +%Y-%m-%d)) + 1))"
   ```
2. Create [TASK_FILE] with strict naming:
   ```
   mkdir -p .tasks && touch ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
3. Verify file creation:
   ```
   ls -la ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
4. Copy ENTIRE Task File Template into new file
5. Insert Execution Protocol EXACTLY, in verbatim, by:
   a. Find the protocol content between [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] and [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] markers above
   b. In the task file:
      1. Replace "[FULL EXECUTION PROTOCOL COPY]" with the ENTIRE protocol content from step 5a
      2. Keep the warning header and footer: "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️"
6. Systematically populate ALL placeholders:
   a. Run commands for dynamic values:
      ```
      [DATETIME]="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')"
      [USER_NAME]="$(whoami)"
      [TASK_BRANCH]="$(git branch --show-current)"
      ```
   b. Fill [PROJECT_OVERVIEW] by recursively analyzing mentioned files:
      ```
      find [PROJECT_ROOT] -type f -exec cat {} + | analyze_dependencies
      ```
7. Cross-verify completion:
   - Check ALL template sections exist
   - Confirm NO existing task files were modified
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol
9. Print full task file contents for verification

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm [TASK_FILE] with user before proceeding >>>

## 3. Analysis
1. Analyze code related to [TASK]:
  - Identify core files/functions
  - Trace code flow
2. Document findings in "Analysis" section
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Wait for analysis confirmation >>>

## 4. Proposed Solution
1. Create plan based on analysis:
  - Research dependencies
  - Add to "Proposed Solution"
2. NO code changes yet
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Get solution approval >>>

## 5. Iterate on the task
1. Review "Task Progress" history
2. Plan next changes
3. Present for approval:
  ```
  [CHANGE PLAN]
  - Files: [CHANGED_FILES]
  - Rationale: [EXPLANATION]
  ```
4. If approved:
  - Implement changes
  - Append to "Task Progress":
    ```
    [DATETIME]
    - Modified: [list of files and code changes]
    - Changes: [the changes made as a summary]
    - Reason: [reason for the changes]
    - Blockers: [list of blockers preventing this update from being successful]
    - Status: [UNCONFIRMED|SUCCESSFUL|UNSUCCESSFUL]
    ```
5. Ask user: "Status: SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL?"
6. If UNSUCCESSFUL: Repeat from 5.1
7. If SUCCESSFUL:
  a. Commit? → `git add [FILES] && git commit -m "[SHORT_MSG]"`
  b. More changes? → Repeat step 5
  c. Continue? → Proceed
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

## 6. Task Completion
1. Stage changes (exclude task files):
  ```
  git add --all :!.tasks/*
  ```
2. Commit with message:
  ```
  git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm merge with [MAIN_BRANCH] >>>

## 7. Merge Task Branch
1. Merge explicitly:
  ```
  git checkout [MAIN_BRANCH]
  git merge task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Verify merge:
  ```
  git diff [MAIN_BRANCH] task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

## 8. Delete Task Branch
1. Delete if approved:
  ```
  git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

## 9. Final Review
1. Complete "Final Review" after user confirmation
2. Set step to "All done!"

After reviewing the TODO.md file, I've identified several unimplemented features that need to be addressed:

1. Interactive Activities:
   - Poll component: Advanced visualization options
   - Quiz component: Timed questions feature
   - Word Cloud component: Advanced styling options and word filtering
   - Q&A component: Answer tracking

2. Data Export:
   - PDF report generation with summary statistics, visualizations, and metrics

3. Analytics Dashboard:
   - Time-based engagement metrics

   - User session analytics for device types, geographic distribution, and session duration

4. Backend Implementation:
   - Real-time Communication: Message buffering for Socket.IO
   - Database & Data Layer: Caching strategy and data archiving process

5. Deployment & DevOps:
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Logging and monitoring setup
