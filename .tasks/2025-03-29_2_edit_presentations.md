# Task Description
Fix and finish the editing presentations functionality.

# Project Overview
LearnConnectLive is a real-time interactive presentation platform that allows presenters to engage with their audience through various interactive activities like polls, quizzes, Q&A sessions, and word clouds. The project uses React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, with Socket.IO for real-time communication.

⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️
# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Create feature branch
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN_BRANCH]:
  ```
  git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK_FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
  ```
  git branch --show-current
  ```
4. Update "Current execution step" in [TASK_FILE] to next step

## 2. Create the task file
1. Execute command to generate [TASK_FILE_NAME]:
   ```
   [TASK_FILE_NAME]="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_$(($(ls -1q .tasks | grep -c $(date +%Y-%m-%d)) + 1))"
   ```
2. Create [TASK_FILE] with strict naming:
   ```
   mkdir -p .tasks && touch ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
3. Verify file creation:
   ```
   ls -la ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
4. Copy ENTIRE Task File Template into new file
5. Insert Execution Protocol EXACTLY, in verbatim, by:
   a. Find the protocol content between [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] and [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] markers above
   b. In the task file:
      1. Replace "[FULL EXECUTION PROTOCOL COPY]" with the ENTIRE protocol content from step 5a
      2. Keep the warning header and footer: "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️"
6. Systematically populate ALL placeholders:
   a. Run commands for dynamic values:
      ```
      [DATETIME]="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')"
      [USER_NAME]="$(whoami)"
      [TASK_BRANCH]="$(git branch --show-current)"
      ```
   b. Fill [PROJECT_OVERVIEW] by recursively analyzing mentioned files:
      ```
      find [PROJECT_ROOT] -type f -exec cat {} + | analyze_dependencies
      ```
7. Cross-verify completion:
   - Check ALL template sections exist
   - Confirm NO existing task files were modified
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol
9. Print full task file contents for verification

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm [TASK_FILE] with user before proceeding >>>

## 3. Analysis
1. Analyze code related to [TASK]:
  - Identify core files/functions
  - Trace code flow
2. Document findings in "Analysis" section
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the execution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Wait for analysis confirmation >>>

## 4. Proposed Solution
Current execution step: 4. Proposed Solution

Based on the analysis, the following improvements will be implemented to fix and complete the editing presentations functionality:

1. **Create Activity Editing Components**:
   - Implement dedicated modal components for editing each activity type:
     - `EditPollModal.js` - For configuring poll options
     - `EditQuizModal.js` - For managing quiz questions and answers
     - `EditWordCloudModal.js` - For configuring word cloud settings
     - `EditQAModal.js` - For setting up Q&A sessions
     - `EditSurveyModal.js` - For creating surveys

2. **Integrate API Calls**:
   - Replace mock data with actual API calls in the EditPresentation component
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Add validation before submitting data

3. **Enhance Activity Configuration**:
   - Add comprehensive configuration options for each activity type
   - Implement validation for activity-specific properties
   - Support for the advanced features already implemented in the activity components

4. **Add Preview Functionality**:
   - Create a preview mode that shows how activities will appear to participants
   - Allow toggling between edit and preview modes

5. **Improve UX/UI**:
   - Add drag-and-drop reordering of activities
   - Implement better visual feedback for user actions
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the activity editing modal components
2. Update the EditPresentation component to use these modals
3. Integrate real API calls
4. Add preview functionality
5. Implement UI/UX improvements

# Analysis
Current execution step: 3. Analysis

The Edit Presentations functionality in the LearnConnectLive application currently has the following components and implementation:

## Frontend Components
1. **EditPresentation Component** (`frontend/src/pages/EditPresentation/index.js`):
   - Basic form for editing presentation title and description
   - List view of existing activities with edit and delete options
   - Interface to add new activities of different types (poll, quiz, wordcloud, Q&A, survey)
   - Currently uses mock data for demonstration purposes
   - Missing dedicated activity editing interfaces for each activity type
   - No real API integration - using setTimeout to simulate API calls

## Backend Implementation
1. **Presentation Routes** (`backend/src/routes/presentations.js`):
   - Complete REST API endpoints for presentations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Error handling with fallback to mock data
   - Proper validation of inputs

2. **Data Services**:
   - **Firestore Service** (`backend/src/services/firestoreService.js`):
     - Implements CRUD operations for presentations
     - Handles activities as subcollections
     - Proper error handling with fallback to mock data
   - **Mock Data Service** (`backend/src/services/mockDataService.js`):
     - Provides mock implementations for development
     - Stores data in JSON files

## Issues Identified
1. **Missing Activity Editing UI**:
   - No dedicated interfaces for editing specific activity types
   - The `handleEditActivity` function only shows an alert message
   - Need to implement proper editing modals/forms for each activity type

2. **Incomplete Data Flow**:
   - Mock data is used in the frontend
   - No real API integration in the EditPresentation component
   - Activities are not properly saved with their specific configurations

3. **Limited Activity Type Support**:
   - Basic activity types are defined but lack complete configuration options
   - No validation for activity-specific properties

4. **No Preview Functionality**:
   - Users cannot preview how activities will appear to participants
